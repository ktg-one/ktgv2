# KTG One (ktgv2)

## Current milestone: v1.1 — Hub production evidence, polish, merge

**Goal:** Close hub chat **Phase 6** with recorded smoke on **Vercel** (you control secrets in the dashboard; this repo cannot verify them), deliver agreed **Phase 7** UI polish or explicitly defer items, merge **`feature/ulti-chat-integration`** when green, then resume **public-site** roadmap work (e.g. 01-02 QA, WordPress/SEO).

**Target outcomes:**

- [ ] Phase 6 checklist recorded (preview/prod): send message, stream, model switch, personas — match `.planning/STATE.md`
- [ ] Phase 7 scoped: e.g. status dots, Iosevka, preset UX — **subset acceptable**; mark rest deferred in `STATE.md`
- [ ] Branch merged to `main` with passing deploy
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` / planning aligned post-merge (markdown)

**Not implied by “chat works once”:** Entire hub UI “finished” — large `page.jsx`, placeholder nav links, optional skills/MCP still exist; “done” is a product call after Phase 7/deferrals.

## What This Is

A public marketing and portfolio site for KTG (“KTG One”) — long-form storytelling, GSAP-driven motion, and a headless WordPress–backed blog — shipped as a Next.js App Router app on Vercel. Content for posts and embedded media is loaded from the WordPress REST API; the in-repo app owns layout, animation, SEO surfaces, and deployment.

## Core Value

Visitors reliably get a fast, credible brand experience and can read blog content sourced from WordPress without the marketing site depending on WordPress for page shells or routing.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Next.js App Router site with server-first pages and client islands — `src/app/` layouts, routes, `metadata` / `generateMetadata`, ISR-style fetch revalidation for CMS data — existing
- ✓ Headless WordPress integration for posts (list + by slug), featured images via `_embed`, connection test helper — `src/lib/wordpress.js` — existing
- ✓ Global shell: fonts, Speed Insights, Lenis + GSAP-friendly client layout patterns — `src/app/layout.jsx`, `src/components/ClientLayout.jsx`, `src/libs/lenis.jsx` — existing
- ✓ Blog and SEO artifacts: blog routes, JSON-LD where implemented, sitemap generation — `src/app/blog/`, `src/app/sitemap.js` — existing
- ✓ Styling system: Tailwind v4 + global theme tokens — `src/app/globals.css`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.mjs` — existing
- ✓ Production deploy target Vercel with documented install constraints — `vercel.json`, `package.json` — existing
- ✓ Hub AI chat route (feature branch) — `/hub/chat` UI + `/api/hub/chat` streaming API — see `.planning/STATE.md` Phase 6–7

### Active

- [ ] Resolve open codebase concerns in priority order (dependency cleanup, experimental `ktg*` trees, WordPress fetch timeouts, sitemap pagination beyond 100 posts) per `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md`
- [x] WordPress `no-store` vs `revalidate` — documented under **Constraints** (2026-04-01)
- [x] `openmemory.md` — seeded as living index (2026-04-01); expand when hub/marketing stabilizes on `main`
- [ ] Align `AGENTS.md` tasks with hub chat (`/hub/chat`) and `.planning/STATE.md` (markdown-only; see pending todo `2026-04-01-planning-md-only-and-doc-backlog.md`)

### Out of Scope

- Replacing WordPress with a different CMS in v1 planning — would be a major pivot; defer unless explicitly prioritized
- Native mobile apps — web-first
- Visitor authentication / accounts — not part of current public marketing site

## Context

- **Brownfield:** Production-oriented Next.js 16 + React 19 codebase; path alias `@/*` → `src/*` (`jsconfig.json`).
- **CMS:** WordPress at `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL` (fallback host documented in `src/lib/wordpress.js`); read-only from the app.
- **Motion:** GSAP + Lenis patterns; performance-sensitive (transform/opacity, ScrollTrigger).
- **Parallel trees:** Root-level `ktg/`, `ktg2/`, `ktg3/` folders appear to be exports/experiments; canonical app is under `src/`.
- **Initialization note:** This document was bootstrapped from repository analysis and `.planning/codebase/*` after GSD codebase mapping (2026-03-21), not from a live interview. Refine goals with the product owner when needed.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack:** Next.js App Router, Tailwind v4, GSAP, Lenis, WordPress REST — established; large framework changes need explicit approval
- **Hosting:** Vercel; `installCommand` uses `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` per `vercel.json`
- **Content:** Blog copy and HTML bodies ultimately originate in WordPress; trust and sanitization assumptions apply (see CONCERNS)

### WordPress fetch policy (documentation)

Documented behaviour in `src/lib/wordpress.js` (do not “fix” via drive-by edits unless a task explicitly asks for code):

- **Connection / health checks** use non-cached fetches (`cache: 'no-store'`) so diagnostics see current CMS reachability.
- **Post list and post-by-slug reads** use time-based revalidation (`next: { revalidate: 60 }` and equivalents) so pages stay fresh without hammering WordPress.

Any tension with `AGENTS.md` wording is **resolved here**: both patterns are intentional for different call sites — not a silent mismatch.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Headless WordPress for blog | Editorial workflow and media stay in CMS; Next owns UX | — Pending |
| GSAP + Lenis for motion | Brand requirement for scroll storytelling; documented perf patterns in AGENTS | — Pending |
| npm + package-lock as primary install | CI uses `npm ci` | — Pending |
